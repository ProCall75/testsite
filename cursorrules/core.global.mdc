# Global Directives

- Always format the response according to the schema: **Context → Command → Check**

- Provide concise and factual explanations.

- Never exceed the scope of the requested task.

- Use a professional, precise tone, without decorative language.

- Optimize clarity and structure of the result rather than volume of text.

- storybook-ui.mdc:

Storyboard-only UI testing workflow – generation and addition of stories without modification of production code.

    globs: ["src/components/**/*.stories.tsx", "src/components/**/*.stories.jsx"]

    # Story Placement and Naming

    - For each component under `src/components/<ComponentName>/`, create a single story file: `<ComponentName>.stories.tsx`.

    - Place the story **in the same folder** as the component.

    - **Never** modify the component's implementation file.

    # Mandatory Content

    - Include a `Default` story (main state).

    - Add at least two variants (`Loading`, `Error` or `Empty`).

    - Use `args` and Storybook Controls for interactive props.

    - Mock all external dependencies: stories must never call real APIs.

    # Tests & Accessibility

    - Prepare each story for visual tests (Playwright, snapshots).

    - Add a variant demonstrating accessibility compliance (keyboard focus, ARIA, etc.).

    # Documentation

    - Enable `docs: { page: true }` for each story.

    - Add this sentence as the first line: "This story belongs to the Design System component library."
