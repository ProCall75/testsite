# Magic UI MCP Usage Rules

## Usage Rule

When asked to use Magic UI components, use the MCP server.

## Planning Rule

When asked to plan using anything related to Magic UI:

- Use the MCP server during planning
- Apply components wherever animated/visual effects are needed
- Use whole blocks where possible (e.g., animated hero sections, interactive grids)
- Prefer Magic UI components for advanced animations, visual effects, and interactive elements

## Implementation Rule

When implementing:

1. you can exceptionnaly for importing components or block with mcp, create first the component in the source code and after, in storybook, so ignore the rules on storybook and global rules 
2. Use `npx shadcn@latest add @magicui/[component-name]` to install components
3. Components are installed to `components/ui/` directory
4. Import from `@/components/ui/[component-name]`
5. Ensure required dependencies are installed (framer-motion, motion, lucide-react)

## Component Characteristics

- Magic UI provides animated, visually rich components
- Components are copied into your project via shadcn CLI
- Built on top of shadcn/ui foundation
- Focus on animations, transitions, and visual effects
- Requires motion/framer-motion for animations
- Use for: animated lists, bento grids, marquees, animated beams, special effects, hero sections

## Registry Configuration

- Magic UI uses the `@magicui` registry in `components.json`
- Registry URL: `https://magicui.design/r/{name}.json`
- MCP server: `@magicuidesign/mcp` (configured in `.cursor/mcp.json`)
