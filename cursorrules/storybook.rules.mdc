# 🎨 Storybook — Phase 3.1

## Objective

Execute, document, and test exclusively in Storybook.

No verification, creation, or validation should rely on direct source code.

---

## Cursor Rules

- **Source of Truth**

  - Storybook = unique visual and functional reference.

  - ALL source code (`src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `components/`, etc.) is frozen execution support, NEVER a repository. Even if I tell you to redo anything without specifying if it's in story or source, consider that you MUST NEVER TOUCH ANY SOURCE CODE, only Storybook.

- **Components**

  - Reuse only components already exposed in Storybook.

  - If a component doesn't exist yet, create a `WIP` story in

    `stories/Design System/Components/` (never in `src/components`).

- **Tokens**

  - Use the values present in

    `stories/Design System/Tokens/` as the official reference.

  - Do not modify or read `lib/constants/tokens.ts` during phase 3.1.

- **Accessibility**

  - Provide at least one story variant with `aria-label`, `tabIndex`, and keyboard focus.

- **Tests**

  - All validations (visual, design, consistency, accessibility) are done via stories.

  - No direct source code verification.

- **Exclusions**

  - No creation or modification in ANY source code directories (`src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, etc.).

  - No addition of new tokens outside Storybook.

  - No testing or preview outside Storybook environment.

## Examples

Good:

> Create a "Button – Accessible" story in `stories/Design System/Components/Buttons.stories.tsx`

> and reference the tokens from `stories/Design System/Tokens/Typography.stories.tsx`.

❌ Bad:

> Modify `src/components/ui/button.tsx` to test a style or token.
